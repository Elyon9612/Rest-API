#API server setup
API server should read the location (i.e. hostname, port, and database name) and credentials (i.e. username and password) for your database from environment variables.

#Database
Mongodb



A MongoDB database running in a Docker container can be initialized by writing a JavaScript script (i.e. a .js file) and mounting that file so that it lives in the directory /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/ in the MongoDB container. See the "Initializing a fresh instance" section of the MongoDB Docker Image Docs Your database initialization script should, at a minimum, create a new, low-privileged user to use to connect to your database from your API server. If you like, you can also put some initial data into your database. Your initialization script will use the same syntax as is used to run commands in the MongoDB shell (e.g. db.createUser(...), db.collection.insert(...), etc.). Once the script is created, put it into a host-machine directory that you bind mount to the directory /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/ in your container.
